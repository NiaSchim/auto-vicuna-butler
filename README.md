# auto-vicuna-butler
a hacked and Frankensteined version of baby-agi ( https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi ), modified to run entirely offline through the use of vicuna.

(also it comes with a version of itself, inside of itself, like a nesting doll, no clue why I did that! ...I guess I want the butler to have access to its own code...
