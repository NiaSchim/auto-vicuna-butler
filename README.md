# auto-vicuna-butler
It was planned to be a hacked and Frankensteined version of baby-agi ( https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi ), modified to run entirely offline through the use of vicuna. But I think we're going a different route, black-box cloning auto-gpt, into Vicuna-GPT with the help of Llama.cpp. did you follow all of that?
